#          Snow Leopard (10.6) floor guard, run INSTEAD of shipyard's 10.9 gate
#          for a -legacy106 build. Per binary:
#            (1) arch exactly x86_64
#            (2) LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX == 10.6
#            (3) the 10.6 shims are DEFINED (not left as dynamic imports):
#                _arc4random_buf (the cgo package) + the toolchain's
#                _clock_gettime; _strnlen/_dirfd/_pthread_main_thread_np are
#                not referenced by this toolchain's runtime and may be absent.
#            (4) GOAMD64=v1 opcode audit: Core 2 has no POPCNT (SIGILL).
#                Under v1, Go 1.26 inline-multi-versions math/bits PER FUNCTION:
#                one runtime.x86HasPOPCNT check at the function entry guards
#                every popcnt in that function's body with a software fallback.
#                The audit verifies that every non-runtime function containing
#                popcnt also contains the x86HasPOPCNT reference somewhere in
#                its body (matching the compiler's emission model). Runtime-
#                internal sites (countbody, pageBits, scanObjects*) are allowed
#                as a bounded set: that exact code is hardware-proven on a
#                Core 2 P8700 (a full tailscaled ran joined for hours).
#          Fail-closed if nothing measured.
#
# platform: the stock 10.9 gate asserts LC_VERSION_MIN == 10.9 exactly, so it
#           would (correctly!) reject a 10.6-floor binary; this is its 10.6 twin.
